why React:
it is used when we want to upadate as many objects and varialble on the website in one click.

babel:it is a transpiler which convert a modern js code to old js code like ES6+ versions

Hooks:
allows us to use function made in react without using class components in js
they are like functions or methods in the react library which we can use directly by import from the library.
1. useState it takes value from the declared variables like:
let [var_name, function that upadate value]
  let [count, setcount] = useState(1)

it search the variable in the DOM and instantly upadate all the variables on the webpage 
but js is not able to do so we have to update each by append new value to the DOM
that's why hooks are useful...



fiber:
in react fiber are method or function which is used to update the end result with update in parts to avoid animation 
drop in react. used to pause about or reuse the previous work as new updates come. it also priortise the updates.

reconciliation:(Virtual DOM)
algo use to differentiate two trees ((browser)DOM tree and react(createroot) tree) in which tree we have to make the 
update.
